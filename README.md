# Twirl
Todo List and Reminder Application

### Engineering Behind Twirl

Twirl was built using Swift and the Realm API. It was built from the ground up without using storyboards and was programmed entirely using swift. I also soley designed the application using the Sketch App.


There are several core development concepts and different IOS APIs utilized in this application:

1. Data Persistence using Core Data / Realm 
2. MVC Development Pattern
3. Notification Services and Scheduled Local Notifications
4. Utilization of Notification and Realm API
5. Multithreading to optimize speed

Feel free to check out the code or watch the videos demoing the application below:
